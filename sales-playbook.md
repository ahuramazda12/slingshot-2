Hey [Name],

Thanks for reaching out about [Project]!

Based on what you shared, our packages might not be the best fit right now - our campaigns start at $1K and it sounds like you're working with a tighter budget.

A few suggestions:
- Build organic engagement first
- Join our L2 community to participate in campaigns
- Reach back out when you've got budget for a proper push

Rooting for you!

## Objection Handling

**"Too expensive"**
> "I hear you. What's your budget? We might be able to start with a Raid Package at $1K to prove the value, then scale up."

**"We work with individual KOLs"**
> "Totally valid. The difference is we're coordinated - you get 10+ accounts working together, plus you get a real report at the end. Most KOLs just post and move on."

**"We'll do it ourselves"**
> "Respect that. If you want to test us first, we can do a single Raid for $1K. Low risk way to see if we're worth it."

**"Need to think about it"**
> "Of course. Proposal's valid for 72 hours - after that, scheduling might shift. Any questions I can answer now to help the decision?"

**"Can you guarantee results?"**
> "We guarantee deliverables - the engagements, the Space, the threads. We can't guarantee token price or follower count because too many variables. But we track everything and show you exactly what you got."
