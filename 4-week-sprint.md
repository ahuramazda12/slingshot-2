## Daily Standup Format (Optional)

If Squadron wants to stay synced, async daily update in group chat:

```
STANDUP - [Date]
Name: [Your name]

Yesterday:
- [What you did]

Today:
- [What you're doing]

Blockers:
- [Anything stopping you]

Wins:
- [Any good news]
```

---

## Escalation Protocol

### If We're Behind on Outreach
- BD Lead calls emergency sync
- Redistribute targets
- Consider quality over quantity (better DMs, fewer sent)

### If Deals Aren't Closing
- Review objections heard
- Adjust pricing or packaging
- Get on more calls (volume)
- Consider offering first deal free for case study

### If Execution Fails
- Document what went wrong
- Apologize to partner immediately
- Offer make-good (partial refund, bonus campaign)
- Fix process before next execution

### If Squadron Member Goes Dark
- 48hr no response: Direct outreach from another member
- 1 week no response: Reassign their tasks
- Discuss in retrospective
