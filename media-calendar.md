3. Apologize to audience, don't throw guest under bus
4. Follow up with guest privately after
5. Reschedule or refund based on circumstances

### Technical Issues
1. If host can't access: Backup host takes over
2. If Space crashes: Restart immediately, tweet new link
3. If recording fails: Apologize, offer partial refund or bonus content

1. Don't panic - quality over quantity
2. Engage deeply with who's there
3. Create great content anyway (recording matters)
4. Review promo strategy after
